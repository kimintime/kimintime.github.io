					<h2 class="div">Book Trailers</h2>
						<p class="paragraph p">In addition to editing, I've also added a few short compositions for book trailers. My main weapon of choice is the ukulele, sometimes keyboard, all in Garageband for iOS.</p>
					<h2 class="div">Destination Unknown</h2>
						<p class="p">Destination Unknown was done with a Koaloha concert pikake, recorded with the Apogee mic into an iPad Air 2 using Garageband. I was lucky with this one, in that I came up with the tune, recorded it, and it just so happened to sync up perfectly on the first try!</p>

					<h2 class="div">Dying Thoughts: First Touch</h2>
						<p class="p">The Dying Thoughts series is 8 books, so through the years, I've really gotten to know Tara, and so I really wanted to introduce a central theme for her. It's a challenge when you're working with just about 30 seconds though, but as book trailers for this series get released, I plan to use this theme and maybe variate it a little. It was recorded mostly with the Risa uke solid tenor, plugged into an Apogee Jam, into the iPad Air 2 using Garageband.</p>

						</div>
					<h2 class="div">Dying Thoughts: Second Sight</h2>
						<p class="p">Another slight variation on the Tara theme, the little riff that resolves to the end is stolen from one of my husband's guitar riffs. I use the G chord shape to move up the fretboard, and it has a more rock-feel. Tara's dad is a former rockstar, and I wanted to give a nod to that in her theme.</p>

						</div>
					<h2 class="div">Cramping Chronicles: First Twinge</h2>
						<p class="p">The first book in a new series, I wanted to once again play around with thematic writing, and being more melodic. It's a challenge to establish an idea in not-a-lot of time, but if it sounds disjointed, that's on purpose. Jesse lives in a world of chronic pain, and she doesn't always know where it's coming from, and I wanted that to reflect in the sound.</p>

					<h2 class="div">Lights Out</h2>
						<p class="p">With this series, I wanted to do a theme that would be linked with the series. I'm not really a composer, so I set myself a challenge this time of trying to be more melodic, melodies don't come easy to me, but I think I stumbled on something here that works. I was listening to The Editors - The Weight of Your Love (An excellent album to go along with this series, take it from the Editor ;) ) a lot during this time, and I think that's why a bit of synth found its way in.</p>

					<h2 class="div">Lights On</h2>
						<p class="p">I used the Risa uke solid tenor once again, and the Kanilea superconcert, plugged into the irig pro i/o, into an iPad Air 3 running Garageband.</p>

					<h2 class="div">Lights Off</h2>
						<p class="p">The final book in the trilogy, that if there was any fairness in the world would be coming to a streaming service near you. Just, maybe scored by someone else!</p>
